            This is a repository of <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">SeqMonk</a> vistories.  These are 
            report documents which accurately describe an analysis perfomred within SeqMonk.
        </p> 

        <p>
            In this system you can search through the submitted Vistories to find one which matches the analysis you are trying to perform 
            so you can replicate and adapt the techniques shown to the question you are trying to address.
